<p>The desire to own the biggest, baddest, shiniest forklift fresh off the assembly line is understandable. Keep these statistics in mind while training workers and safely operating forklifts. This additional clearance requires installing larger tires and in order to do that, you need to get everything up off the ground more.

Pallet jacks - also called order pickers, typical pallet jacks can lift approximately 3,300 pounds. DaytonÂ® pallet trucks feature a cushion grip with a 3-position lever and a flow valve for controlled lowering.</p>
<p>While the machine is designed to work on rough terrain, it isn't always set to work on all types of terrain. When you rent a forklift from Gregory Poole Lift Systems, you get the adaptability you need from your forklift fleet, without a huge impact on your bottom line. Many lifted truck owners purchased standard vehicles and later make modifications to them, either by themselves or with the help of a mechanic.</p>
<p>Hydraulic Pallet Truck is designed with polyurethane rollers that allow the machine to operate easily. The suspension lift kit, on the other hand, actually modifies the structure of the suspension so it sits higher off the ground, giving you significantly more ground clearance. If you've got one, you know washing a lifted truck can be tricky. Don't wait - our lifted trucks have a high interest and they won't last long.</p>

These kinds of lift kits are popular because no work is necessary to adjust the suspension or other mechanical systems on the truck.
