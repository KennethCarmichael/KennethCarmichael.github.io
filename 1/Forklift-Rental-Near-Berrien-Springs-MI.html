<p>You must know how to safely load, unload, and drive a rough terrain forklift to prevent accidents and injuries. This is best if you have a large warehouse or need different types of lifts for the jobs you'll be doing. If you test drive your lifted trucks hurriedly, you will fail to pay close attention to some signs you should be watching out for. The Forklift Order Picker Cages have durable wire mesh backs and side panels and are to be used in conjunction with a body harness (for working at heights).</p>
