<h2>Electric Pallet Jack Stratford</h2>
<p>Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing.

New and used Reach Trucks are also available depending on the length of rental and budget.
