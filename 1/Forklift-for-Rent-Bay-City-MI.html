<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Telehandlers look and function like forklifts, but have a telescopic boom that can extend forwards and upwards for different attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, or muck grab. If the forklift truck in front is driving too slow. Handling processes will be slowed down, the equipment will experience increased wear and tear, and it may even suffer serious damage under excessive loads.</p>
<p>At Frank Kent CDJR, we have used lifted trucks for sale, and our expert service staff can install lift kits into one of our new or used pickups for you. For instance, KION North America Corp., Summerville, S.C., released three new Linde electric pallet trucks delivering load capacities of 2,600-4,500 pounds.

<p>In trucks where the operator is seated, a vertical clearance of at least 39 inches should be maintained from the point of maximum depression of the seat under the operator to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation.
