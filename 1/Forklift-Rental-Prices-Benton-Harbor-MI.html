<h3>What You Need To Know When Buying Electric Pallet Trucks Benton Harbor MI 49022</h3>
<p>Supporting a forklift platform is operated on a firm flat surface. If you need the forklift to operate under a fixed height structure, such as a container door then you should also consider the collapsed height of the mast. With maximum lift capacities of 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, respectively, JCB's 930 and 940 rough-terrain, straight-mast forklift models are purpose-built with a one-piece frame.</p>
<p>These rough terrain forklifts come with a higher ground clearance that is crucial to work on cross-country terrain. A forklift that is overloaded while lifting a load at height can very easily tip over forwards, with potential of causing serious damage to property, equipment, and people. But work can go a lot quicker if you have the right equipment to help you out—and pallet jack is one of the most convenient and efficient types of equipment out there for the job.</p>
