Narrow Aisle Trucks greatly mitigate the risk of injuries to the operator as well as damage to property while working in tight spaces. Providing the best value in Linde forklift trucks available today, Granite Industrial Trucks, Inc. Adding a suspension lift kit to your truck is a complex procedure that involves a lot of working parts. If you're looking for a little extra clearance and bigger, badder tires for the ultimate off-road experience, this might be exactly the lift you're looking for.</p>
<p>So while you may find cheaper custom trucks elsewhere, we doubt they'll compare to the quality you get from us. Granite industrial carries an inventory full of used Baker and Linde forklift truck parts. Most order picker forklifts have a 4-point suspension mechanism between the rear tires and the front wheels. The wheels and tires are key components that set rough terrain forklifts apart from standard models.</p>
