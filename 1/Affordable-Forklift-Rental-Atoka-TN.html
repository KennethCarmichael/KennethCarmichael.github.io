We are a full-service forklift and material handling equipment dealer, proudly located in Phoenix and serving the great state of Arizona.

The load capacity of the forklift will restrict the load capacity of the order picker cages. These kits cannot be installed in vehicles with a unibody construction, such as the Jeep Cherokee.</p>
