Larger Tires: You're able to attach larger tires to a lifted truck to get more traction off road or in snow.</p>
<p>Forklifts, at maximum, can only travel 8 mph or 3 mph around people, but even at that speed, one of these 4-ton vehicle's steel tusks can puncture your machinery and shut down your operation.
