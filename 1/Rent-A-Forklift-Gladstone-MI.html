<p>Typical career steps are to become a sales associate or forklift operator. The jack is steered by a ' tiller ' like lever that also acts as the pump handle for raising the jack. There are three types of lift kits, each of which affects the truck in different ways. Each will be covered to help you choose if buying a lifted truck is in your best interest. Our Lift Trucks offers a complete range of durable lift trucks designed to handle your material handling applications.</p>
<p>Trucks employing a horizontal (vertical axis) handwheel have been built with directional-reverse steer (i.e. a control that causes a truck to turn to the operator's right on clockwise rotation of the steering handwheel when the operator is facing away from the direction of normal forward travel.) For this reason directional-reverse steer is permissible for this type of truck.</p>
<p>The cost to rent a narrow aisle forklift is roughly $200 to $300 per day, $400 to $500 per week, and $1,000 to $1,500 per month. These machines can also navigate fields, pastures, pens, and loading areas. The largest of the "core" line of cushion trucks, the 15,500 lb. truck has the largest counterweight and the largest lifting capacity. Because of the additional weight from larger tires on your lifted truck, frequent oil changes are recommended when you lift your truck or SUV.</p>
