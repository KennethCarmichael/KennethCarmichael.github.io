<h2>Good Forklift Hydraulic Parts Give Your Truck Muscle in Hammond </h2>
<p>At Ahern Rentals, we have the rental equipment that you need for your next project. Standup forklifts are "step in step out" minimizing the amount of time an operator spends mounting the truck. We buy and sell used forklifts, aerial lifts, rail car movers, attachments, racking & shelving and surplus warehouse equipment. The 2C5000 became the primary model in 2010 and had maintained its status as one of the premier forklift models ever since.</p>
<p>If the operator must frequently enter and exit the forklift to access product, build pallets, etc. Ask what kind of lift it is, who installed it and if there have been any problems with it. Most lifted trucks are bought used so bring along a flash light and inspect the truck for crusted mud in the vehicle's nooks and crannies. Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>
