<p>JCB rough terrain forklifts are a reliable, comfortable, versatile and easy-to-use solution for any challenging rehandling environment. A electric hand pallet truck is one of the most commonly used lift trucks in industrial companies. Should you operate forklift trucks you will be aware that all drivers need to be properly trained and certified. We're here to answer your questions and to finally put to rest which is better, a lifted truck or a lowered truck. Yet, another place where pallet trucks can be useful that is often overlooked is in a retail work environment.</p>

<p>These Class 4 forklifts are one of the most commonly used forklifts in the U.S., typically used indoors for applications such as manufacturing, warehousing, bottling, and trucking. Linear speed control, an option on many competitors' trucks, is standard on all SP models and utilizes a variable height sensor to measure platform height and determine the optimum speed level.</p>
<p>In addition our finance department has warranties that can give you peace of mind with your new lifted truck. In most instances, renting a forklift makes more sense than buying one. Whenever a truck is equipped with vertical only, or vertical and horizontal travel controls elevatable with the lifting carriage or forks for lifting personnel, the following additional precautions should be taken for the protection of personnel being elevated.</p>
