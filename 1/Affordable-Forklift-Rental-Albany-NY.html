<p>In the mid-1940s, producers started to make rough terrain forklifts. Moreover, the increasing effort from the end users to efficiently utilize supply chain will create demand for Pallet Trucks to handle large number of transaction expected to further increase in the coming years as well.

<p>Layman's Terms: The panhard bar is a vital ingredient when lifting a truck, it helps the suspension not to twist and cause excessive body roll. Equipment dealers generally have a much wider range of rental equipment to meet a broader range of applications. With rated load capacities commonly ranging between 5,500 lbs and 12,000 lbs, popular models include power shift transmission and all-wheel steering as well as a number of additional steering features that allow the operator to position the lift as close to the work area as possible.</p>
