View our entire inventory of New or Used Rough Terrain Forklift Equipment. However, it does suggest that people without previous experience driving a lifted truck should test-drive one of a similar height before lifting their own.</p>
<p>The rough terrain forklift dates back to about 1946 when a two-pronged lift attachment was placed on a power buggy or tractor chassis. Meanwhile, two Chinese forklift giants integrate resources to be more competitive in key components. Where typical fork lift trucks need to approach a load head on, on a flat even surface, an all-terrain or rough terrain forklift can pick up a load even when the load is on a slope or otherwise unusually positioned.</p>

Powered by a lithium-ion battery, this electric pallet truck offers up to 3 hours of use. Depending on the quality of your shocks, you'll likely enjoy more control of your vehicle and higher ground clearance as well.
