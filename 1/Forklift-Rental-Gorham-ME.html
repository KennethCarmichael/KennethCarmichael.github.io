This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>
<p>On completion of this conversion training, operators will have an demonstrated a robust understanding of the operational features and techniques associated to 4 way directional reach truck operations. If a lifted truck's front or rear bumper is 20 inches taller than a car bumper, we are looking at the truck's bumper clearing the car's hood and impacting the windshield.</p>
<p>With the Operator Presence Sensing (OPS) System, the reach truck becomes inoperative when the floor switch cannot detect the driver. For nearly 50 years, customers have relied on the Cat lift trucks brand for quality and reliable forklifts backed by exceptional service and support through its trusted dealer network.
