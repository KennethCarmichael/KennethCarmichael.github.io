<p>All types of dockboards should be designed and maintained so the end edges will have a substantial contact with the dock (or loading platform) and the carrier to prevent the dockboard from rocking of sliding. The increased tire size and ground clearance makes off-roading increasingly possible by limiting the potential damage of debris, as well as providing an overall smoother ride across the rough ground.</p>

<h3>Forklift Safety Guideline Herriman UT 84096</h3>
<p>All-terrain and rough terrain forklifts are the preferred lift truck type for construction sites, ranches, farms and other outdoor environments. If you don't see what you want, AutoNation Chevrolet South Clearwater can custom order one for you and get the off-road lifted truck in 3-6 weeks.

Give us a call if you have any questions or have an interest in finding out additional information about these trucks.</p>
<p>These rough terrain forklifts come with a higher ground clearance that is crucial to work on cross-country terrain. A forklift that is overloaded while lifting a load at height can very easily tip over forwards, with potential of causing serious damage to property, equipment, and people. But work can go a lot quicker if you have the right equipment to help you out—and pallet jack is one of the most convenient and efficient types of equipment out there for the job.</p>
