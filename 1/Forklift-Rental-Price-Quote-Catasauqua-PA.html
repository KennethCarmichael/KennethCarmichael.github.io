<p>Diamond now has separate websites for Equipment and Event Rentals. Sign up today with FLC's comprehensive, OSHA compliant counterbalance forklift license training. Damage to both the forklift and load can be increased when the reach is extended while the truck is moving. We are one leading and largest supplier of Hydraulic Pallet Truck in North India. The most important part of parking lot safety for any vehicle, lifted or not, is being aware of your surroundings.</p>
<p>That's why our focus is making the forklift rental process quick and easy, without the usual red tape and fine print of the big rental companies. The 37-inch-wide C-G chassis—about five to six inches narrower than the chassis of a typical 4,000 to 7,000 lb. forklift—allows C-G Series forklifts to navigate tight rack storage aisles. Our stores in Sacramento, CA and throughout northern central California are fully equipped to meet your demands for rental forklifts.</p>
<h2>Industrial Lift Truck Company Catasauqua </h2>

With lift capacities of 5,000, 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, respectively, the three established G Series rough-terrain forklift models offered by Case can be equipped with two mast heights — 15 and 22 feet — to cover most applications.</p>
