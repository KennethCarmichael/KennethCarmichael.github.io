From forklifts to HGVs, our accredited courses will teach you to become a competent operator, learning practical operating skills, health and safety fundamentals, how to inspect machinery and how to troubleshoot problems.</p>
<p>Our counterbalanced fork trucks are ideal for operations that require breakdown of pallets removed from trailers, long runs to P&D stations, or a combination of both. Larger items may be attached to a pallet or have indents for fork lifting built into the item itself.
