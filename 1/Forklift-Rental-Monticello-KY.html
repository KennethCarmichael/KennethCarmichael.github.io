At Solution MHE, we also have a dedicated engineering team, so if you ever experience any technical issues with your forklifts, you need only give us a call. That piece of equipment is known as the pallet jack It is possibly one of the most versatile, durable and useful pieces of material handling equipment available.</p>

Commonly lifted vehicles include most pickups and large SUVs, especially the Ford Excursion Any vehicle designed for off-road use, however, can be lifted. Counterbalance forklifts are just one of several types of forklifts found in today's workplaces.</p>
<h2>The History Of The Hand Pallet Truck Monticello </h2>
<p>A forklift is a type of material handling lift that has two prongs attached to the front of it. These prongs look like a tuning fork and assist in the lifting of objects. The forklift's center of gravity moves when you accelerate, brake, or turn. With a capacity to pack them one on top of each other, our range of material handling equipment reduces the transporting time by half.</p>
<p>Unlike most other companies in the equipment rental space, Herc Rentals offers a number of tools along with their tractors and forklifts. Our hand pallet truck steering wheels in Nylon and PU are available in the markets with the customization facilities to cater to the ever changing needs of clients. You can get a lifted truck at home with a lift kit, have it done professionally, or buy a truck that is already lifted.</p>
<p>Any time the forklift's center of gravity moves outside the stability triangle, the lift will tip over. Like the pallets themselves, pallet jacks have become a lot more standardized in North America as of late. Southeast Forklifts specializes in high quality, thoroughly inspected and reconditioned equipment you can trust. From the moment you first step into the reception area, decorated with handmade up-cycled furniture built from old pallets to the large warehouse space where the forklifts, order pickers, boom, and scissor lifts all operate, we have made a huge effort for the whole place to be a positive, professional, clean, modern and friendly environment.</p>
