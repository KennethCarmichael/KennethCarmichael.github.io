<p>We will deliver a fully serviced and maintained machine to your business premises or job site to take the hassle out of purchasing or hiring a forklift.

Trained drivers use the controls to turn the rough terrain forklift or to drive it forward or backward.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
