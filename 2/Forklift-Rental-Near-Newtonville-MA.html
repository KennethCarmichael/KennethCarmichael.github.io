<p>At the time, Vincent Halma, president and CEO of KION North America, said the rate at which we're releasing new products and services is truly unprecedented.” KION also recently announced plans to expand its South Carolina facility capacity to 12,000 lift trucks a year by 2020, up from 3,000 in 2015. The most obvious benefit is the increased ground clearance when driving over rugged terrain, which reduces the risk of damage to your undercarriage.</p>
<h2>Hand Lift Truck Newtonville</h2>
<p>Powered High-Lift Trucks: Order-Picker Safety is an exceptional program which focuses on the issues that will keep your order-pickers safe. Unstable, off-center loads. Reach truck with pantograph attachment that scissors forward from the mast. Also worth noting, I teach to OSHA's forklift standard 1910.178 and cover material related to general industry and not construction-specific subject matter.</p>
<p>Each type of powered industrial truck presents different operating hazards. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ), the three most common types of forklift injuries happen when: 1) A forklift rolls or overturns.

Whatever the reason, National Forklift Exchange offers an array of used forklifts for sale and can guide you through every stage of buying a used forklift. Hyster® Reach Trucks are versatile and highly maneuverable. As rental rates can be assessed differently, spelling out the time period can save you money by getting reduced long-term rates or reducing the term of your rental to the tightest possible time period.</p>

Rough-terrrain lifts are particularly prone to abuse if they were employed at a construction site.</p>
