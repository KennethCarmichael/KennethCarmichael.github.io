<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck. Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst. Designed for heavy loads, high reach, and extreme maneuverability, a forklift can make quick work of moving, loading, storing and unloading all sorts of loads.</p>
<p>At Frank Kent CDJR, we have used lifted trucks for sale, and our expert service staff can install lift kits into one of our new or used pickups for you. For instance, KION North America Corp., Summerville, S.C., released three new Linde electric pallet trucks delivering load capacities of 2,600-4,500 pounds. Buying diesel forklifts are the other option and are easy to refuel.</p>

<p>Motorized hand trucks must enter elevator or other confined areas with load end forward. There is a structure of movable parts which enable proper operating of the forklifts. The Industrial Duty Pallet Jack is great for small spaces, and handles easily.
