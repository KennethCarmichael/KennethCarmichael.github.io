The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the test load center dimension and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity load of the truck.</p>
<p>Motorized hand trucks must enter elevator or other confined areas with load end forward. There is a structure of movable parts which enable proper operating of the forklifts. The Industrial Duty Pallet Jack is great for small spaces, and handles easily. The Hummer seems to be able to age well no matter how old it gets; and it also somehow avoids the Tonka toy look that sometimes befouls trucks when you try to put tires too large on them.</p>
