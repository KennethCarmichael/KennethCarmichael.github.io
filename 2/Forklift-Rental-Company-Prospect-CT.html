While some may know forklifts primarily as a material handling appliance, there are in fact many different categories of forklifts. As the fork lift trucks are usually quite expensive, many industry enterprises choose to buy used forklifts on industrial auctions, which reduces the cost of the process they implement.</p>
<h2>For Lift Truck Prospect</h2>
<p>Powered High-Lift Trucks: Order-Picker Safety is an exceptional program which focuses on the issues that will keep your order-pickers safe. Unstable, off-center loads. Reach truck with pantograph attachment that scissors forward from the mast.

<p>Side Loader popularity has been declining due to the more advanced multi-directional forklift that has taken its place as the king of long load handling. We've got forklifts reserved and maintained for rental customers, with everything from forklift hand pallet trucks, powered pallet truck forklifts and stacking forklifts through to 12 tonne forklifts and specialised very narrow aisle equipment.</p>
