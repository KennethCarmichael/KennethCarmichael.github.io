<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>Discover our range of electric forklifts: designed for different purposes, all with the same world class ergonomics. Rough Terrain lifts are usually powered by internal combustion engines that require refueling. Our machines are tough and will get the job done, but be sure to check out our other used 4-wheel forklifts for sale if you're looking for more options.</p>

The LHM200SC pallet truck in the BT Lifter L-series is equipped with a scale to provide high-accuracy weighing during the material handling process. Lifted truck maintenance services require assessment of your brakes, shocks, wheels, as well as tires.</p>
