<p>Considerations include forklift type, capacity, carriage type, and number of hydraulic functions (that power the attachment features). In the past most order picking jobs were carried out on ground level to increase the productivity, while stock was replenished to the bottom layer with reach & fork trucks. A typical lift truck uses two power-operated horizontal prongs (forks) that can be raised and lowered for loading, transporting, and unloading goods, particularly goods stacked on wooden pallets.</p>
<p>In the event of a crash with a lifted truck, the injuries can be extensive. Furthermore, training enables an operator to operate the equipment in a safe manner, which reduces potential accidents. The convenience of forklifts grew so much so that a great many used indoor lifts can be found in farms today. Contact your local MCFA forklift dealer to learn about your rental options.</p>
