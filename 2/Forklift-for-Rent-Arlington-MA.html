We are a full-service forklift and material handling equipment dealer, proudly located in Phoenix and serving the great state of Arizona. This course covers how to safely and efficiently operate a rough terrain forklift, how to educate and evaluate other operators on their rough terrain forklift performance, identifying when and how to service and maintain forklifts and how to keep other workers around the forklift area safe.</p>
<p>About 41% of these are forklifts, 1% are truck body parts, and 1% are digital signage and displays. Knowing your specific needs and what forklift type best fits your application is very important when renting equipment for your job site. Case Construction - one of the largest manufacturers of rough terrain lifts, Case all-terrain lifts are noteworthy for their max lift capacity and excellent handling.</p>
