<p>Adding a Pro Comp lift kit to your vehicle will help to maintain vehicle ride height, reduce the effect of shock forces, maintain wheel alignment, support loaded weight, and control the direction of travel for your truck or SUV. Often called a tugger,” these versatile machines are most commonly used for pulling loads from Point A to Point B rather than lifting.</p>
<h2>Be Aware When Operating a Fork Lift Truck in Ashland </h2>
<p>Designed for the operator to ride up on the platform and pull product. From electric pallet jacks to narrow aisle lift trucks or sit-down rider forklifts, we'll help you find exactly what you need and get it to your facility when you need it. Any surface a forklift drives on must be able to support the forklift and its load with a safety factor of four. If you intend to go beyond a short-term rental, consider talking with your local MCFA lift truck dealer first to make sure you get the most out of your forklift rental.</p>
<p>As long as the needs of your business fit the abilities and the strengths of the forklift, both the electric forklift and electric reach stacker can be extremely beneficial to your company. Suspension Lift Kit: If money's not an object and you want to go all out for a kit that lifts both your body and suspension for maximum off-road capabilities, a suspension lift kit is the way to go.</p>

The counterbalance” term refers to the weight distribution for cargo loads; any pallets or merchandise are counterbalanced against the weight of the machine.
