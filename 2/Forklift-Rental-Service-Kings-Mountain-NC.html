<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>Our Lorry Loader training course (HIAB) delivered by Lift A Load Training ensures successful candidates have the basic knowledge and practical skills involved in safely operating a lorry loader. These high performers from brands such as Mitsubishi , Heli , Toyota , Hyster and Yale are ready for any stacking, moving, lifting or handling job you may have, whether indoor or outdoor.</p>

A new line of high-speed Clearview and Freelift masts range from 15 to 30 feet, and are lighter in weight with larger side thrust rollers. Benefits of Training - Completing a forklift driver training course helps an operator to maximize productivity and complete all assigned tasks such as loading and unloading pallets promptly.</p>
<p>Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing. Prior to 2011 all States and Territories of Australia independently regulated occupational health and safety in that state, including forklift licensing.</p>
<p>Order picker forklifts are usually powered by electric motors because they don't generate noxious fumes.

Most trucks on the market today are built with what is commonly referred to as a body-on-frame design; the frame is built for the engine, drivetrain, and suspension, then a separate body is attached to the frame.</p>
<p>Orderpickers will be used in applications where pallet trucks, rolling ladders, and other piece-picking methods are traditionally used.
