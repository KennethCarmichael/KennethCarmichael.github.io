To counter this trend and the associated challenges for the driver and reach truck, Linde has developed features such as Dynamic Mast Control to compensate for mast oscillation, introduced numerous measures to optimize visibility, and incorporated load displays.</p>
<p>As long as the needs of your business fit the abilities and the strengths of the forklift, both the electric forklift and electric reach stacker can be extremely beneficial to your company. Suspension Lift Kit: If money's not an object and you want to go all out for a kit that lifts both your body and suspension for maximum off-road capabilities, a suspension lift kit is the way to go.</p>

<p>Lifted trucks have a negative reputation for being unsafe, but that's simply untrue. This determines how heavy of a load the forklift can handle, and at what different heights.
