This series offers models for rough-terrain applications as well. Originally a lock company, Hyster-Yale is now almost exclusively a forklift manufacturer. And with how much you can save with a high-quality pre-owned vehicle and still get behind the wheel of a safe, reliable, and ready for adventure car, truck or SUV.</p>
<p>Guide rails, or electronic (or similar) guidance are suggested when lift trucks are operating in an area only used for stock pickers, side loaders, or order pickers.
