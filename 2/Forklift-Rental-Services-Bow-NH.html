<p>Jacks can also lessen fatigue of employees, as they won't be taking on the physical toll of moving heavy material. If you refuel the tanks twice a day (the average for full-time use), this equates to a yearly fuel cost of $1,500 for electric, $15,000 for diesel and about $12,500 for propane. Often considered to be in a class of their own are aerial lifts , which give a single operator the ability to boom himself up to a hard-to-reach area in a man basket.‚Äù This category includes a wide variety of personnel lifts, including boom lifts and scissor lifts.</p>

<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
