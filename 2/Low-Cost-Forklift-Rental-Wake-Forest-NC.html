One of the top reasons to consider lifted trucks for sale is because of their rugged good looks. They also invest heavily in the design of their machines to ensure optimal performance even on jobsites that include limited access terrain and high-reach areas. The forklift is designed with a load limit for the forks which is decreased with fork elevation and undercutting of the load (i.e., when a load does not butt against the fork "L").</p>

<h3>Important Replacement Forklift Parts in Wake Forest NC 27587</h3>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, an empty truck with the forks elevated to any height up to the maximum height at which horizontal travel is permitted, and for the travel speed allowable at that height, should not overturn when the test platform, and for the travel speed allowable at that height, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified by Graph D, Curve 1, for unrestricted turning and by Graph D, Curve 2, for straight forward and reverse travel, travel, no turning ± 10 degrees.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
