Alternate capacities may be established at the same specified load center and at less than maximum elevation of the load engaging means. Detrich says that such features as the clear-view” mast (with lift cylinders on the outside of the mast to provide an unhindered view to the forks), shorter turning radii, hydraulic side-shift of carriage and forks, and improved ergonomic operator platforms result in machines that provide operators with greater control, convenience, and comfort.</p>
