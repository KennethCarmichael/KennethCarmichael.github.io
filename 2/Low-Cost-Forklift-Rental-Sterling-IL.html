<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.). The most significant difference between a standard industrial forklift (such as a Toyota) and a rough terrain forklift are the tires and ground clearance.</p>
<p>Therefore owing to the communication advancements, the growth for the connected Forklift Trucks will gain traction over the forecast period. Rough terrain forklifts have the ability to tackle a wide range of site conditions - from pavement and hills to mud and back again. With longer shift life, proven diagnostics, and a global parts and service network, users of the Crown SP Series high-level order pickers are sure to experience more satisfaction, longer forklift life and lower total costs.</p>
<p>Wang says that Hangcha will continue to invest in rough-terrain R&D, particularly in developing equipment with more tonnage and configurations. Rough terrain poses additional threats and risks to the operators of forklifts. However, suspension lift kits let the truck owners lift their truck as high as they want. They have been renting out equipment for over 50 years.</p>

<p>Typically, these types of vehicles are known as forklifts or lift trucks. When you buy a pallet truck then you will come across many varieties in the market.
