<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.). The most significant difference between a standard industrial forklift (such as a Toyota) and a rough terrain forklift are the tires and ground clearance.</p>
<p>Therefore owing to the communication advancements, the growth for the connected Forklift Trucks will gain traction over the forecast period. Rough terrain forklifts have the ability to tackle a wide range of site conditions - from pavement and hills to mud and back again. With longer shift life, proven diagnostics, and a global parts and service network, users of the Crown SP Series high-level order pickers are sure to experience more satisfaction, longer forklift life and lower total costs.</p>
