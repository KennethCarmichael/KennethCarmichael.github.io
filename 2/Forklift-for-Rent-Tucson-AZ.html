As an operator of a counterbalance forklift, you could find yourself in many different types of workplaces; from constructions sites to ports, warehouses, storage yards and factories.</p>

Therefore, no matter what the specific characteristics are of the individual pallet jack, it is still one of the most versatile and usable pieces of moving equipment for any business to have readily available for everyday use.</p>
<h2>Interesting Forklift Facts and History in Tucson </h2>
<p>A forklift is a type of material handling lift that has two prongs attached to the front of it. These prongs look like a tuning fork and assist in the lifting of objects. The forklift's center of gravity moves when you accelerate, brake, or turn. With a capacity to pack them one on top of each other, our range of material handling equipment reduces the transporting time by half.</p>
<p>All types of dockboards should be designed and maintained so the end edges will have a substantial contact with the dock (or loading platform) and the carrier to prevent the dockboard from rocking of sliding. The increased tire size and ground clearance makes off-roading increasingly possible by limiting the potential damage of debris, as well as providing an overall smoother ride across the rough ground.</p>
<p>Furniture picking has a very specific order picker that includes a larger platform for more ease and productivity when moving bulky and odd-sized loads. We recommend this pallet jack due to its' heavy duty structure and its affordability. 42% of the forklift fatalities are caused by forklift driver being crushed by a lift truck that tips over.
