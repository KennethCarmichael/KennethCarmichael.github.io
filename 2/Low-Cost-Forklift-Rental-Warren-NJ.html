<p>BJ's Rentals, Inc. Here at East Midlands Forklifts , we provide comprehensive forklift training for a variety of trucks and at various levels. An overhead guard is intended to offer protection from the impact of small packages, boxes, bagged material, etc., representative of the job application, but not to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load. Two lifting-fork order pickers allow the operator to vary the load height to reduce the need for reaching and bending.</p>
<p>Never use a diesel engine, internal combustion gas, or propane powered lift truck models in confined spaces for long periods of time. Yet large trucks can't be raised and driven safely until their brakes are modified. Conform with manufacturers requirements as per the operators handbook, other types of information source and relevant regulations and legislation.</p>

Trucks with suspension lifts tend to handle quite a bit different than factory models, not only due to the higher center of gravity but also because of the changes to the suspension.</p>
