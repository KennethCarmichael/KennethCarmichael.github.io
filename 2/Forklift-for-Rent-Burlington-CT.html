The order picker's multi-function control handle incorporates a solid base for a secure grip, providing precise control of travel and lifting functions.

Forklift rental is by far the most flexible and cost effective way to ensure your warehouse operation or distribution center is fully equipped during high volume periods, eliminating bottlenecks and productivity losses.</p>
