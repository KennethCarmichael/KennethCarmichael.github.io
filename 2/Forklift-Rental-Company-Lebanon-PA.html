<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Telehandlers look and function like forklifts, but have a telescopic boom that can extend forwards and upwards for different attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, or muck grab. If the forklift truck in front is driving too slow. Handling processes will be slowed down, the equipment will experience increased wear and tear, and it may even suffer serious damage under excessive loads.</p>

In order to ensure quality, these pallet trucks are stringently tested on several parameters by Our qualified experts. We are your source for the best daily, weekly, or monthly prices on rentals including Cat, Hyster, and Toyota brands.</p>
