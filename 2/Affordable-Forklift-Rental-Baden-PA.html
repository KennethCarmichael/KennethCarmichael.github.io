Counterbalanced forklifts have been a source of storage and handling systems, where they perform loading, stacking, distribution and horizontal transport functions. Renting is ideal for short-term jobs or situations where equipment needs may change quickly.</p>

Whatever the reason, National Forklift Exchange offers an array of used forklifts for sale and can guide you through every stage of buying a used forklift. Hyster® Reach Trucks are versatile and highly maneuverable. As rental rates can be assessed differently, spelling out the time period can save you money by getting reduced long-term rates or reducing the term of your rental to the tightest possible time period.</p>
<p>Scissor lifts provide access for people or equipment to height-restricted areas (up to 90').

<p>These trucks are designed to lift the operator to retrieve items. Almost identical to the 6,000 lb. 4-wheel, the 6,500 lb. truck has a slightly heavier counterweight. If other tests of tests for trucks over 20,000 lb rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parties. If you imagine all three points connected into a triangle, this is the forklift's stability triangle.</p>

A truck with a lift kit has a higher center of gravity than a stock truck from the factory.</p>
