Pallet jacks can bear a lot of weight, but they also have limits that cannot be safely exceeded.</p>

Whether you use rough terrain forklifts every day or once in awhile, these machines can handle major wear and tear.</p>
<p>Instead, pump trucks rely on good old-fashioned manual labor as the operator pumps” the jack to lift the skids with their own force. Inquire about specific used forklifts that are in your price range and meet your requirements. The standard course is intended to last for 5 days but for an experienced Forklift Truck Operator who holds a valid or recently expired certificate, a 3 day refresher can be attended.</p>
